_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       y: a time series where outliers are to be detected.

       x: a time series or an ‘stsm’ object.

    xreg: an optional matrix of regressors with the same number of rows
          as ‘y’.

    cval: a numeric. The critical value to determine the significance
          of each type of outlier.

   delta: a numeric. Parameter of the temporary change type of outlier.

 n.start: a numeric. The number of warming observations added to the
          input passed to the Kalman filter. Only for ‘tsmethod =
          "stsm"’.

   types: a character vector indicating the type of outlier to be
          considered by the detection procedure: innovational outliers
          (‘"IO"’), additive outliers (‘"AO"’), level shifts (‘"LS"’),
          temporary changes (‘"TC"’) and seasonal level shifts
          (‘"SLS"’).

   maxit: a numeric. The maximum number of iterations.

maxit.iloop: a numeric. The maximum number of iterations in the inner
          loop.  See ‘locate.outliers’.

maxit.oloop: a numeric. The maximum number of iterations in the outer
          loop.

cval.reduce: a numeric. Factor by which ‘cval’ is reduced if the
          procedure is run on the adjusted series, if ‘maxit > 1’.

discard.method: a character. The method used in the second stage of the
          procedure.  See ‘discard.outliers’.

discard.cval: a numeric. The critical value to determine the
          significance of each type of outlier in the second stage of
          the procedure (discard outliers). By default it is set equal
          to ‘cval’. See details.

remove.method: deprecated, argument ‘discard.method’ should be used.

remove.cval: deprecated, argument ‘discard.cval’ should be used.

tsmethod: a character. The framework for time series modelling. It
          basically is the name of the function to which the arguments
          defined in ‘args.tsmethod’ are referred to.

args.tsmethod: an optional list containing arguments to be passed to
          the function invoking the method selected in ‘tsmethod’.

args.tsmodel: an optional list containing the arguments to be passed to
          ‘stsm.model’. Only for ‘tsmethod = "stsm"’
     .

 logfile: a character or ‘NULL’. It is the path to the file where
          tracking information is printed. Ignored if ‘NULL’.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Five types of outliers can be considered.  By default: ‘"AO"’
     additive outliers, ‘"LS"’ level shifts, and ‘"TC"’ temporary
     changes are selected; ‘"IO"’ innovative outliers and ‘"SLS"’
     seasonal level shifts can also be selected.

     ‘tso0’ is mostly a wrapper function around the functions
     ‘locate.outliers’ and ‘discard.outliers’.

     ‘tso’ iterates around ‘tso0’ first for the original series and
     then for the adjusted series. The process stops if no additional
     outliers are found in the current iteration or if ‘maxit’
     iterations are reached.

     ‘tso0’ is an auxiliar function (it is the workhorse for ‘tso’ but
     it is not intended to be called directly by the user, use
     ‘tso(maxit = 1, ...)’ instead. ‘tso0’ does not check the arguments
     since they are assumed to be passed already checked by ‘tso’; the
     default value for ‘cval’ is not based on the sample size. For the
     time being, ‘tso0’ is exported in the NAMESPACE since it is
     convenient for debugging.

     If no value is specified for argument ‘cval’ a default value based
     on the sample size is used. Let n be the number of observations.
     If n <= 50 then ‘cval’ is set equal to 3.0; If n >= 450 then
     ‘cval’ is set equal to 4.0; otherwise ‘cval’ is set equal to 3 +
     0.0025 * (n - 50).

     If ‘tsmethod’ is ‘NULL’, the following default arguments are used
     in the function selected in ‘tsmethod’: ‘tsmethod = "auto.arima"’:
     ‘allowdrift = FALSE’, ‘ic = "bic"’; ‘tsmethod = "arima"’ = ‘order
     = c(0, 1, 1)’ ‘seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1))’; ‘tsmethod =
     "stsm"’ = ‘stsm.method = "maxlik.fd.scoring"’, ‘step = NULL’,
     ‘information = "expected"’.

     If ‘args.tsmethod’ is ‘NULL’, the following lists are used by
     default, respectively for each method: ‘auto.arima’:
     ‘list(allowdrift = FALSE, ic = "bic")’; ‘arima’: ‘list(order =
     c(0, 1, 1), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1)))’: ‘stsm’:
     ‘list(stsm.method = "maxlik.fd.scoring", step = NULL, information
     = "expected"))’.

     ‘xreg’ must be a matrix with time series attributes, ‘tsp’, that
     must be the same same as ‘tsp(x)’. Column names are also
     compulsory. If there is only one regressor it may still have
     non-null dimension, i.e.  it must be a one-column matrix.

     The external regressors (if any) should be defined in the argument
     ‘xreg’. However, they may be also defined as an element in
     ‘args.tsmethod’ since this list is passed to function that fits
     the model. The function ‘tso’ deals with this possibility and
     returns a warning if ‘"xreg"’ is defined twice with different
     values. No checks are done in ‘tso0’.

     If ‘tsmethod = "stsm"’, the structural time series model can be
     defined through argument ‘args.tsmodel’, which is passed to
     function ‘stsm.model’. By default, the local level model is chosen
     for series with one sample per unit of time (e.g. annual data) and
     the basic structural model for seasonal data; ‘ssd = TRUE’ and
     ‘sgfc = TRUE’.

     If ‘maxit = 1’ the procedure is run only once on the original
     series. If ‘maxit > 1’ the procedure is run iteratively, first for
     the original series and then for the adjusted series. The critical
     value used for the adjusted series may be reduced by the factor
     ‘cval.reduce’, equal to 0.14286 by default. The new critical value
     is defined as cval * (1 - cval.reduce).

     By default, the same critical value is used in the first stage of
     the procedure (location of outliers) and in the second stage
     (discard outliers).  Under the framework of structural time series
     models I noticed that the default critical value based on the
     sample size is too high, since all the potential outliers located
     in the first stage were discarded in the second stage (even in
     simulated series with known location of outliers).  In order to
     investigate this issue, the argument ‘discard.cval’ has been
     added.  In this way a different critical value can be used in the
     second stage.  Alternatively, the argument ‘discard.cval’ could be
     omitted and simply choose a lower critical value, ‘cval’, to be
     used in both stages. However, using the argument ‘discard.cval’ is
     more convenient since it avoids locating too many outliers in the
     first stage.

     ‘discard.cval’ is not affected by ‘cval.reduce’.
